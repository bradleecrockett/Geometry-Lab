Complete the required functions in ```geometry.py```
so that they calculate and return the appropriate 
values as described in the comments. 

Be sure to complete the header block appropriately with
your name and date etc.

Complete each function so that it returns the appropriate value for the given parameters. Run the program to ensure that the calculations look correct.

When then functions all work properly, run ```test_geometry.py```. All tests in  should pass 
when you run the ```test_geometry.py``` file. You should see 6 tests that pass and have green check marks.
